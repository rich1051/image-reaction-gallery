# Weekend React Gallery

## Description

The Weekend React Gallery is a fully-functioning full-stack app primarily utilizing the power of React.js to display a social media image gallery, similar to that of Instagram, to the DOM. Upon click of each image, conditional rendering allows a caption to replace the image. The user can also click the 'like' button below each image, which will add to the total 'like' count.

## Installation

- Running the server code requires `nodemon`. Install it globally with `npm install nodemon --global`.
- Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
- Run `npm run server` in your terminal
- Run `npm run client` in your terminal
- The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!

## Built With

Visual Studio Code, React.js, Axios, and Express
